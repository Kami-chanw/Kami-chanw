After delving into the book "Style: The Basics of Clarity and Grace," I distilled its essence into several key items, reminiscent of my once-favorite technical series, "Effective C++." I hope this can help readers to hone their writing skills with these insights.

- [Part I: Actions and Characters](#part-i-actions-and-characters)
  - [Item 1: Make Important Actions Verbs](#item-1-make-important-actions-verbs)
  - [Item 2: Get Characters into Subjects](#item-2-get-characters-into-subjects)
  - [Item 3: Reconstruct Absent Characters](#item-3-reconstruct-absent-characters)
  - [Item 4: Use Abstractions as Characters Carefully](#item-4-use-abstractions-as-characters-carefully)
  - [Item 6: Choose Between Active and Passive](#item-6-choose-between-active-and-passive)
  - [Item 7: Break Long Compound Noun Phrase](#item-7-break-long-compound-noun-phrase)


## Item 0: Draft Without Perfection
Although I have summarized a series of principles below, please do not treat these principles as rules to be imposed on every sentence as you draft it, but as guidelines to help you identify sentences that are likely to cause your readers trouble and then to revise them.

If you get bogged down in the details, you will never finish your first draft. Most experienced writers get something down as fast as they can. Then, as they revise that first draft into something clearer, they understand their ideas better. And when they understand their ideas better, they express them more clearly, and the more clearly they express them, the better they understand them—and so it goes, until they run out of energy, interest, or time.

# Part I: Actions and Characters
## Item 1: Make Important Actions Verbs
Consider the following two sentences:

<ol type="a">
<li> Once upon a time, as a <u><b>walk</b></u> through the woods was taking place on the part of <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>, the <i>Wolf</i>’s <b><u>jump</u></b> out from behind a tree occurred, causing her <b>fright</b>.</li>

<li> Once upon a time, <u><i>Little Red Riding Hood</i></u> was <b>walking</b> through the woods, when the <u><i>Wolf</i></u> <b>jumped</b> out from behind a tree and <b>frightened</b> her.</li>
</ol>

Sentence (a) seems verbose and indirect. The two main characters (italicized), *Little Red Riding Hood* and the *Wolf*, are not subjects (underlined), and their actions (bold) —<b>walk</b>, <b>jump</b>, and <b>fright</b>—are presented as nouns rather than verbs. In sentence (b), the more direct sentence, those two main characters are subjects and their actions are verbs. That's why we prefer (b).

Let’s revise a different sentence as an example:
<ul>
The outsourcing of high-tech work to Asia by corporations means the loss of jobs for many American workers.
</ul>

**Step 1: Identify the main characters and their corresponding actions.**
<ul>
The <u><b>outsourcing</b></u> of high-tech work to Asia by <i>corporations</i> means the <u><b>loss</b></u> of jobs for many <i>American workers</i>.
</ul>

**Step 2: Convert nominalizations into verbs.** Assign the characters as subjects and rewrite the sentence using subordinating conjunctions such as *because*, *if*, *when*, *although*, *why*, *how*, *whether*, or *that*.
<ul>
Many <i><u>American workers</u></i> are <b>losing</b> their jobs because <i><u>corporations</u></i> are <b>outsourcing</b> their high-tech work to Asia.
</ul>

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
<b>Exercise: Try to spot and revise nominalizations.</b>
<br/>
<ol>
<li> 
The intention of the committee is to audit the records.
</li>
<details>
<summary><b>Hint</b></summary>
The nominalization "intention" is the subject of an empty verb such as <i>be</i>, <i>seems</i>, or <i>has</i>.
Replace the nominalization with a verb and find a character that would serve as the subject of that verb.
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
The <i><u>committee</u></i> <b>intends</b> to audit the records.
</details>
<li> 
The agency conducted an investigation into the matter.
</li>
<details>
<summary><b>Hint</b></summary>
The nominalization "investigation" follows the empty verb "conducted". 
Change the nominalization to a verb and replace the empty verb with the new verb.
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
The <i><u>agency</u></i> <b>investigated</b> the matter.
</details>
<li>
Our loss in sales was a result of their expansion of outlets.
</li>
<details>
<summary><b>Hint</b></summary>
This sentence contains two nominalizations: "loss" and "expansion", both followed by empty verbs. Convert these nominalizations into verbs and identify the characters who should serve as the subjects.
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<i><u>We</u></i> <b>lost</b> sales because <i><u>they</u></i> <b>expanded</b> their outlets.
</details>
<li>
There is no need for our further study of this problem.
</li>
<details>
<summary><b>Hint</b></summary>
A nominalization follows "<i>there be</i>". Replace the nominalization with a verb and identify the character that should serve as the subject of that verb.
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<i><u>We</u></i> <b>need</b> not <b>study</b> this problem further.
</details>
<li>
We did a review of the evolution of the brain.
</li>
<details>
<summary><b>Hint</b></summary>
This sentence contains two nominalizations: "review" and "evolution". Turn the first nominalization into a verb. For the second, you can leave it as is or turn it into a verb in a clause beginning with <i>how</i> or <i>why</i>.
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<i><u>We</u></i> <b>reviewed</b> the <b>evolution</b> of the <i>brain</i>. <br>
<i><u>We</u></i> <b>reviewed</b> how the <i><u>brain</u></i> <b>evolved</b>.
</details>
</ol>
</div>

## Item 2: Get Characters into Subjects
Consider following three sentences:
<ol>
<li>The <i><u>CIA</u></i> <b>feared</b> the <i><u>president</u></i> would <b>recommend</b> to <i>Congress</i> that <i><u>it</u></i> <b>reduce</b> <i>its</i> budget. </li>
<li> The <u><b>fear</b></u> of the <i>CIA</i> was that a <u><b>recommendation</b></u> from the <i>president</i> 
to <i>Congress</i> would be for a <b>reduction</b> in <i>its</i> budget. </li>
<li> <u>There</u> was <b>fear</b> that <u>there</u> would be a <b>recommendation</b> for a budget <b>reduction</b>.</li>
</ol>
Most readers think (a) is clearer than (b) and (c).
In (b), the two simple subjects (underlined) are not concrete 
characters but abstractions. Even worse, in (c), characters are deleted entirely, which may be ambiguous for readers.

Let’s revise a different sentence as an example:
<ul>
Governmental intervention in fast-changing technologies has led to 
the distortion of market evolution and interference in new product 
development.
</ul>

**Step 1: Find the main characters.** They may be possessive pronouns 
attached to nominalizations, objects of prepositions (particularly *by* and *of*), or only implied. 
<ul>
<i>Governmental</i> intervention in fast-changing technologies has led to 
the distortion of <i>market</i> evolution and interference in new product 
development.
</ul>

**Step 2: Skim the passage for actions involving those characters**, 
particularly actions buried in nominalizations. Ask Who is doing what?

<table style="border-collapse: collapse; border: none; font-size: 0.9em;">
    <tr>
        <td style="border: none;"><i>governmental</i> <b>intervention</b></td>
        <td style="text-align: center; border: none;">→</td>
        <td style="border: none;"><i>government</i> <b>intervenes</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="border: none;"><b>distortion</b></td>
        <td style="text-align: center; border: none;">→</td>
        <td style="border: none;"><i>[government]</i> <b>distorts</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="border: none;"><i>market</i> <b>evolution</b></td>
        <td style="text-align: center; border: none;">→</td>
        <td style="border: none;"><i>markets</i> <b>evolve</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="border: none;"><b>interference</b></td>
        <td style="text-align: center; border: none;">→</td>
        <td style="border: none;"><i>[government]</i> <b>interferes</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="border: none;"><b>development</b></td>
        <td style="text-align: center; border: none;">→</td>
        <td style="border: none;"><i>[market]</i> <b>develops</b></td>
    </tr>
</table>

**Step 3: Revise.** Reassemble those new subjects and verbs into a sentence, using conjunctions such as *if*, *although*, *because*, *when*, *how*, and *why*.
<ul>
When a <i>government</i> <b>intervenes</b> in fast-changing technologies, <i>it</i> <b>distorts</b> how <i>markets</i> <b>evolve</b> and <b>interferes</b> with their ability to <b>develop</b> new products.
</ul>

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
<b>Exercise: Try to identify main characters, actions involving those characters, and revise.</b>
<br/>
<ol>
<li> 
Medieval theological debates often addressed issues considered trivial 
by modern philosophical thought.
</li>
<details>
<summary><b>Hint</b></summary>
<strong>Step 1: Find the main characters.</strong><br/>  
The sentence contains two main characters: "Medieval theological debates" and "issues". The former is an abstraction. Replace this abstraction with concrete characters, such as "Medieval theologians."
<br/><br/>

<strong>Step 2: Identify actions involving those characters.</strong><br/>  
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; border: none; font-size: 0.9em;">
    <tr>
        <td style="border: none;"><i>Medieval theological</i> <b>debates</b></td>
        <td style="text-align: center; border: none;">→</td>
        <td style="border: none;"><i>Medieval theologians</i> <b>debate</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="border: none;"><i>issues</i> <b>considered</b></td>
        <td style="text-align: center; border: none;">→</td>
        <td style="border: none;"><i>[philosophers]</i> <b>consider</b> <i>issues</i></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<strong>Step 3: Reassemble the sentence.</strong><br/>  
Turn nominalizations into verbs and reconstruct the sentence by directly linking the characters with their actions. Use conjunctions if needed (e.g., <i>that</i>, <i>which</i>). For example:  
<i>Medieval theologians debated issues that modern philosophers consider trivial.</i>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<i>Medieval theologians</i> often <b>debated</b> <i>issues</i> that modern <i>philosophers</i> <b>consider</b> trivial. 
</details>
</ol>
</div>

## Item 3: Reconstruct Absent Characters
Readers have the biggest problem with sentences devoid of all 
characters:
<ul>
A decision was made in favor of doing a study of the disagreements.
</ul>
That sentence could mean either of these, and more:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li>We decided that I should study why they disagreed.</li>
 <li>I decided that you should study why he disagreed.</li>
</ul>
The writer may know who is doing what, but readers may not and 
so usually need help.

Sometimes we omit characters to make a general statement:
<ul>
<span title="This can't be a sentence a human can write.">Research strategies that look for more than one variable are of more 
use in understanding factors in psychiatric disorder than strategies 
based on the assumption that the presence of psychopathology is dependent on a single gene or on strategies in which only one biological 
variable is studied.</span>
</ul>
But when we try to revise that into something clearer, we have to 
invent characters, then decide what to call them. Do we use *one* or 
*we*, or name a generic “doer”?
<ul>
If <i>one/we/you/researchers</i> are to understand what causes psychiatric 
disorder, <i>one/we/you/they</i> should use research strategies that look for 
more than one variable rather than assume that a single gene is responsible for psychopathology or adopt a strategy in which <i>one/we/
 you/they</i> study only one biological variable.
</ul>
To most of us, *one* feels stiff, but *we* may be ambiguous because 
it can refer just to the writer, to the writer and others but not the 
reader, to the reader and writer but not others, or to everyone. 
And if you are not directly naming your reader, you is usually inappropriate. Directly naming your reader means explicitly identifying who *you* refers to, such as "students", "researchers", or "practitioners", rather than leaving it to the reader to guess whether *you* refers to them personally or to a broader audience.

In general, opt for the most specific character you can find when your sentences are missing characters.

## Item 4: Use Abstractions as Characters Carefully
Sometimes, abstractions can serve as characters, but only when used carefully. Consider this example:

<ul>
To understand what causes psychiatric disorder, <i>studies</i> should look for more than one variable rather than adopt a strategy in which they test only one biological variable or assume that a single gene is responsible for psychopathology.
</ul>

Here, *studies* is an abstraction turned into a virtual character because it performs clear actions: *look*, *adopt*, *test*, and *assume*. Most readers are familiar with the concept of "studies", so this sentence is both clear and easy to follow.

But using abstractions as characters can also create problems. When your audience isn’t familiar with an abstract term—or when you surround it with other abstractions—your writing can quickly become dense and hard to follow. In the following example (actions are boldfaced; human characters are italicized):

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li>The <b>argument</b> is this. The cognitive component of <b>intention</b> exhibits 
a high degree of <b>complexity</b>. <b>Intention</b> is temporally <b>divisible</b> into 
two: prospective <b>intention</b> and immediate <b>intention</b>. The cognitive 
function of prospective <b>intention</b> is the <b>representation</b> of a <i>subject's</i> 
similar past <b>actions</b>, his current situation, and his course of future 
actions. That is, the cognitive component of prospective <b>intention</b> is 
a <b>plan</b>. The cognitive function of immediate <b>intention</b> is the <b>monitoring</b> and <b>guidance</b> of ongoing bodily <b>movement</b>.</li>
</ul>

We can make that passage clearer if we tell its story from the 
point of view of flesh-and-blood characters:
<ul>
<i>I</i> <b>argue</b> this about <b>intention</b>. It has a complex cognitive component of two temporal kinds: prospective and immediate. <i>We</i> <b>use</b> prospective <b>intention</b> to <b>represent</b> how <i>we</i> have <b>acted</b> in our past and present and how <i>we</i> will act in the future. That is, <i>we</i> <b>use</b> the cognitive component of prospective <b>intention</b> to <b>help</b> <i>us</i> <b>plan</b>. <i>We</i> <b>use</b> immediate <b>intention</b> to <b>monitor</b> and <b>guide</b> <i>our</i> bodies as <i>we</i> <b>move</b> them.
</ul>

By introducing human characters (*I* and *we*), this version clarifies who is doing what and makes the explanation easier to follow.

## Item 6: Choose Between Active and Passive
Basically active voice is better, but in the following cases, the passive is often the better choice:

1. **You don’t know who did an action, readers don’t care, or you don’t want them to know.**

    Often, we don’t say who does an action, because we don’t 
know or readers won’t care. For example, we naturally choose 
the passive in these sentences:
    - The president **was rumored** to have considered resigning.
    - Those who **are found** guilty can be fined.
    - Valuable records should always **be kept** in a safe.

    If we do not know who spread rumors, we cannot say. And no 
one doubts who finds people guilty, fines them, or should keep 
records safe, so we don’t have to say. 
2. **You want to shift a long bundle of information to the end of a sentence, especially when doing so lets you begin with a shorter chunk of more familiar information.**

    A sentence confuses us when it opens with information that is unexpected. For example, in this next passage, the subject of the second sentence gives us new and complex information (bold), before we read familiar information that we recall from the previous sentence (italicized).
    - We must decide whether to improve education in the sciences alone or to raise the level of education across the whole  
    curriculum. **The weight given to industrial competitiveness as opposed to the value we attach to the liberal arts** will determine *our decision*.

    But If we use the passive, the short, familiar information (our decision) would be put first, the order we prefer:
    - We must decide whether to improve education in the sciences alone or raise the level of education across the whole curriculum. *Our decision* will be determined **by the weight we give to industrial competitiveness as opposed to the value we attach to the liberal arts**.
3. **You want your readers to focus on a particular character.**
    Consider this paragraph, it reports the end of World War II in europe from the point of view of the Allies:
    - By early 1945, the Allies had essentially **defeated** Germany; all 
that remained was a bloody climax. American, French, British, and Russian forces **had breached** its borders and **were bombing** it around the clock. But they had not yet so **devastated** Germany as to destroy its ability to resist.
    
    If you want to express it from the point of view of Germany, you can use passive verbs to make Germany the subject/character.
    - By early 1945, Germany had essentially **been defeated**; all that 
remained was a bloody climax. Its borders had **been breached**, and it was **being bombed** around the clock. It had not **been so devastated**, however, that it could not resist.

## Item 7: Break Long Compound Noun Phrase
Strings of nouns feel lumpy, so avoid them, especially ones you invent. Revise compound nouns of your own invention, especially when they include nominalizations. Just reverse the order of words and find prepositions to connect them:
<table style="border: none; border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; font-size: 0.9em;">
  <tr style="border: none;">
    <th style="border: none; text-align: center; font-weight: normal;">1</th>
    <th style="border: none; text-align: center; font-weight: normal;">2</th>
    <th style="border: none; text-align: center; font-weight: normal;">3</th>
    <th style="border: none; text-align: center; font-weight: normal;">4</th>
    <th style="border: none; text-align: center; font-weight: normal;">5</th>
  </tr>
  <tr style="border: none;">
    <td style="border: none; text-align: center;">early</td>
    <td style="border: none; text-align: center;">childhood</td>
    <td style="border: none; text-align: center;">thought</td>
    <td style="border: none; text-align: center;">disorder</td>
    <td style="border: none; text-align: center;">misdiagnosis</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="border: none;">
    <td style="border: none; text-align: center;">misdiagnose</td>
    <td style="border: none; text-align: center;">disordered</td>
    <td style="border: none; text-align: center;">thought</td>
    <td style="border: none; text-align: center;">in early</td>
    <td style="border: none; text-align: center;">childhood</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="border: none;">
    <td style="border: none; text-align: center;">5</td>
    <td style="border: none; text-align: center;">4</td>
    <td style="border: none; text-align: center;">3</td>
    <td style="border: none; text-align: center;">1</td>
    <td style="border: none; text-align: center;">2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Reassembled, it looks like this:
<ul>
Physicians misdiagnose<sup>5</sup> disordered<sup>4</sup> thought<sup>3</sup> in young<sup>1</sup> children<sup>2</sup> because they are unfamiliar with recent literature on the subject.
</ul>
If, however, a long compound noun includes a technical term in your field, keep that part of the compound and unpack the rest:
<ul>
Physicians misdiagnose<sup>5</sup> <b>thought disorders</b><sup>3,4</sup> in young<sup>1</sup> children<sup>2</sup> because they are unfamiliar with recent literature on the subject.
</ul>
