After delving into the book "Style: The Basics of Clarity and Grace," I distilled its essence into several key items, reminiscent of my once-favorite technical series, "Effective C++." I hope this can help readers to hone their writing skills with these insights.

## Item 0: Draft Without Perfection
Although I have summarized a series of principles below, please do not treat these principles as rules to be imposed on every sentence as you draft it, but as guidelines to help you identify sentences that are likely to cause your readers trouble and then to revise them.

If you get bogged down in the details, you will never finish your first draft. Most experienced writers get something down as fast as they can. Then, as they revise that first draft into something clearer, they understand their ideas better. And when they understand their ideas better, they express them more clearly, and the more clearly they express them, the better they understand them—and so it goes, until they run out of energy, interest, or time.

# Part I
## Item 1: Make Main Characters Subjects, Make Important Actions Verbs
Consider such two sentences:

<ol type="a">
<li> Once upon a time, as a <u>walk</u> through the woods was taking place on the part of Little Red Riding Hood, the <b>Wolf</b>’s <u>jump</u> out from behind a tree occurred, causing her <u>fright</u>.</li>

<li> Once upon a time, <b>Little Red Riding Hood</b> was <u>walking</u> through the woods, when the <b>Wolf</b> <u>jumped</u> out from behind a tree and <u>frightened</u> her. </li>
</ol>

In (a), the sentence that seems wordy and indirect, the two main characters, **Little Red Riding Hood** and the **Wolf**, are not subjects, and their actions— 
<u>walk</u>, <u>jump</u>, and <u>fright</u>—are not verbs. In (b), the more  direct 
sentence, those two main characters are subjects and their 
actions are verbs. That’s why we prefer (b).

Let's revise a certain sentence as an example:
<ul>
The outsourcing of high-tech work to Asia by corporations 
means the loss of jobs for many American workers.
</ul>

Step 1. Decide who your main characters are, and then look for the actions that those characters perform.

<ul>
The <u>outsourcing</u> of high-tech work to Asia by <b>corporations</b> 
means the <u>loss</u> of jobs for many <b>American workers</b>.
</ul>
Step 2. If the actions are nominalizations, make them verbs. Make the characters the subjects of those verbs.
Rewrite the sentence with subordinating conjunctions such as *because*, *if*, *when*, *although*, *why*, *how*, *whether*, or *that*.

<ul>
Many <b>American workers</b> are <u>losing</u> their jobs, 
<i>because</i> <b>corporations</b> are <u>outsourcing</u> their high-tech work to Asia.
</ul>

<b>Exercise: Try to spot and revise nominalizations. </b>
<br/>
<ol>
<li> 
The intention of the committee is to audit the records.
</li>
<details>
<summary><b>Hint</b></summary>
The nominalization "intention" is the subject of an empty verb such 
as <i>be</i>, <i>seems</i>, or <i>has</i>.
Change the nominalization to a verb and find a character that would be the subject of that verb.
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
The <b>committee</b> <u>intends</u> to audit the records.
</details>
<li> 
The agency conducted an investigation into the matter.
</li>
<details>
<summary><b>Hint</b></summary>
The nominalization "investigation" follows an empty verb "conducted". 
Change the nominalization to a verb and replace the empty verb with the new verb.
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
The <b>agency</b> <u>investigated</u> the matter.
</details>
<li>
Our loss in sales was a result of their expansion of outlets.
</li>
<details>
<summary><b>Hint</b></summary>
The sentence contains two nominalizations "loss" and "expansion" which are followed by an empty verb. 
Revise the nominalizations into verbs and identify the characters that would be the subjects of those verbs.
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<b>We</b> <u>lost</u> sales because <b>they</b> <u>expanded</u> their outlets.
</details>
<li>
There is no need for our further study of this problem.
</li>
<details>
<summary><b>Hint</b></summary>
A nominalization follows <i>there be</i>. 
Change the nominalization to a verb and identify the character that should be the subject of the verb.
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<b>We</b> <u>need</u> not <u>study</u> this problem further.
</details>
<li>
We did a review of the evolution of the brain.
</li>
<details>
<summary><b>Hint</b></summary>
The sentence contains two nominalizations "review" and "evolution" joined by a preposition. 
Turn the first nominalization into a verb, then either leave the second nominalization as it is, 
or turn it into a verb in a clause beginning with <i>how</i> or <i>why</i>:
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<b>We</b> <u>reviewed</u> the evolution of the brain. <br>
<b>We</b> <u>reviewed</u> how the <b>brain</b> <u>evolved</u>
</details>
</ol>
</div>
