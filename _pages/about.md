# About Me
I am currently an undergraduate student at the PALM lab, Department of Computer Science, Southeast University (SEU), China. My research interests are broad, with a primary focus on deep learning and multimodal research. I enjoy developing elegant works and continually exploring new knowledge.

Outside of my academic work, I have a strong interest in neuroscience, particularly in understanding how the brain processes information and how the neural system functions at the biological level. Classical music is another significant part of my life, with a particular focus on symphonies and piano works from the Romantic, Impressionist, and Atonal music periods.
